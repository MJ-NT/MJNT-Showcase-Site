                        Five shifts in the Hive this week, and my feet are killing me. The view from the hub was enough to offset it the first few months. I remember my first day - I was near sweating through the suit, my head was spinning from the climb and the adjusted grav, but the view! I had never seen anything like it. The grime of Sector 4 was gone: the noise and the smell, the moondust that clung to my clothes and my hair, the clamour and the cloying desperation that came with it. That ladder led almost half a mile up. But the view.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the hub, you can see almost to the edge of the moon, where the curve of the Rim frames the horizon. You can see the other Sectors: the high-rises with their penthouse apartments, the hyper-sterile clean suites, the mines that squat below.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        But that charm has worn thin. Now I just make the climb, tend to the drones, submit to the checks, and make the climb again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I sometimes wonder if the drones relate to those percenters in the towers. The view doesn't matter to them. This is just their nest, far enough removed from the smog so they can breed, and make their product. What does that make me? Their servant, perhaps. But they don't pay me - the company pays me, and not nearly enough, if you ask me. So the drones are my colleagues then, and we're all working for the weekend.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My weekends I spend at Carrabin's, a dive bar on Regent's Row. It's a little far from my place but I like that. My friends from work - what friends, the drones? - they won't interrupt me there. I can be a new person, whoever I want.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Carrabin's, I drink, and talk, and laugh. I play slider with the regulars, I make peanut bets on the football, I drink some more. Everyone knows my face, and they always have a smile for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But working days are for the Hive. I make the climb. The tech runs the scan: BALANCE ACCEPTED. I wonder how the drones spend their weekends. This time I pay more attention as I harvest, in a way I haven't done since the first days. They don't look particularly different from Friday - at least, not that I can see. Are they more sluggish perhaps? Does a hangover brew in those dull eyes? Have they rested? Do they rest? I let it lie.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The tech runs the scan: BALANCE ACCEPTED. I climb back down to Sector 4, and Carrabin's.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next day I look again. When I started at the Hive, I couldn't believe creatures like these existed. It's funny how quickly we get used to these things. I read somewhere that if we turned our senses off and then on again, like rebooting an old computer, the sensation of everything we had gotten used to - every day, little-by-little - would overwhelm us. I don't know how they know that. But I do know that somewhere along the line I got bored. Bored of their insect faces, of the tubes and the screens of the apparatus. Bored of the climb, and the scans, and, well, I don't know, now I look again. There's maybe something new about them today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The tech runs the scan: BALANCE ACCEPTED. I go back down.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It becomes almost an obsession after that, examining the drones. Every day I check them, take the product, shift the larvae to the incubators. There is more purpose in my work now, and there is something there. Something in the eyes? I don't know. My own eyes are tired. I need more sleep. I will understand more after sleep.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the end of the shift, I stay in the hub a while and look back out across the open space to the penthouses, and the towers. Then to Carrabin's, then home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next day, I am uncomfortable after the climb. My suit is too tight on me, and my eyes are itching. But the harvest must continue. I bottle the product, sift the impurities, check the drones in their nests; the larvae too. There is definitely something in the eyes. I just need to see them closer. The mask prevents it, so I must remove the mask.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The tech runs the scan: BALANCE REJECTED.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But I am a new person. Whoever I want.
