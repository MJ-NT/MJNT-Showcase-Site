                        The wound was bad. Wyman was no doctor - as his choice of adjective proved - but even he could see that. It was deep, and long, and probably infected. With a cut like that, Kovacs wouldn't be making the jump back even if she survived the initial blood loss. At least up here they wouldn't catch her scent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Clijsters and Gordon were crouched beside her, arguing in hushed tones. Ríos was changing the dressing, at intervals splashing more ammonia around the perimeter of the gondola. Antonescu stood watch by the far door, her profile silhouetted by the dull orange light of the city below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Opposite her, Wyman turned, scanning the station below for any signs of disturbance: nothing. He retreated from the doorway, sliding the panel across until just a sliver remained visible. Clijsters and Gordon had both sparked up, and cigarettes were passed around. Wyman accepted one wordlessly and took a long drag, eyes fixed on Kovacs, who was sucking in short, shallow breaths. He ran some quick mental calculations:
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                        272, minus an estimated 13 for the time delay, divided by 5…
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                        Supposing he was right about the timing, that was 51.8, with a variance of maybe 2 or 3.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                        Now compare to the original figure: 272 divided by 6 is 45.3. That's a difference of 6.5, give or take.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Life was cheap in the Down-and-Out, even before the incursion - isn't that what they were trying to change? Wyman exhaled, the smoke briefly obscuring his face. Six and a half million was a lot of change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kovacs caught his eye, and Wyman glanced away, back through the gap.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was movement below. Wyman's chest tightened - one of them? He couldn't be sure. The distance made it difficult, and he had only glimpsed the figure for a moment, flitting between a darkened alleyway and a parked Buick. The sound of a bell caught his attention. A little way down the street, a couple had spilled out from a milk bar, stumbling into an embrace beneath the pooling light of a streetlamp. Wyman frowned: that was foolish. It was well past the curfew and the law was clear. They only come out at night, so don't be there when they do. He wouldn't risk Greta or the kids for the cheap dusk prices. But he couldn't blame the pair for trying to stretch their dollar, nor the bar for violating curfew hours. If the Council only gave them the means to protect themselves - well, that was why they were here: to take that means. They were the slow knife, and must cut deep: the rot was set in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Movement by the car. Wyman straightened; instinctively felt for the silver at his belt. He had been right, it was one of them, slinking under and around the cars with that characteristic animal grace, slowly and deliberately approaching the couple. The two of them continued along the sidewalk, heedless of their uninvited third. The man was laughing; the woman laid her head on his shoulder. Wyman thought about shouting a warning, but bit his tongue. They wouldn't be able to hear from this distance anyway. A moment later, it struck. Wyman winced; turned away, back to the gondola.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The others were gathered around the injured Kovacs. A grim-faced Clijsters beckoned him over.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “The plan continues” she began, casting a glance at Gordon. “Kovacs stays here until dawn. The rest of us make the next jump. We get to the vault, get the fund, and finally fucking do something”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wyman looked from face to face. Some nodded, others grunted, or gestured the affirmative. He swallowed, and nodded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There had been talks about financing a response in the Down-and-Out since the incursion. Two years in, a fund had finally been established, made available for the councillors to use as they saw fit. But that was no good. The Council had never been a bastion of virtue, but the corruption had only grown in the past couple of years. Clijsters and Gordon, and a few other civil servants in their department, including Wyman, had decided that enough was enough. This city would submit to the scalpel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wyman, their resident accountant, had traced the paper trail to a single vault. He could make the numbers dance, but however skilled he was, he couldn't magic paper bills into ones and zeroes. They needed direct access, some time after it arrived in the vault and before the Council had the chance to syphon it off to whatever slush fund they currently favoured. It had to be tonight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next jump was easier, without the jutting edges of a rusted gondola to contend with. Still, Wyman landed awkwardly, and scrambled for a desperate moment to find purchase on the frost-covered roof before Antonescu reached out to steady him. Together, they descended to the fire escape, where Ríos and Clijsters were already crouched. The dim red light of the chip reader beside the door blinked out at him, and he felt his heart rate slow in sympathy. <em>Blip… blip… blip</em>. Deep breaths now: they were almost inside.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He felt a hand on his shoulder, and Gordon slid past him with a tense smile, fishing the keycard from his jacket pocket. The reader chirped in cheerful response, and the lock disengaged with a soft <em>click</em>. The group took a collective breath. Before tonight, Wyman would be hard-pressed to think of a single significant look he had shared with anyone, other than perhaps his wife. He had registered at least 5 within the last hour.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Inside, the familiar smell of paper, ink and polished metal washed over them, mingling with their own foreign bouquet of ammonia and sweat. There was that strange sensation that comes from being somewhere familiar out-of-hours. It was like exploring the mall at night, Wyman thought. He felt he shouldn't be there - which of course was true.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ríos led them forward. He had made friends with the night shift a while back, and had promised one of the old hands a bottle of something good in exchange for a peek at the access codes. That was Ríos: disarming charm; everybody's friend. But moving through the dimly-lit corridors, Wyman's feeling of unease only grew. At the second fire door, he nudged Clijsters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Are the lights supposed to be like this?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She shrugged. “Never been here at night before. An energy-saving measure perhaps?”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wyman grunted: it looked more like emergency lighting to him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the first checkpoint. Ríos motioned for the others to stay back, then straightened, adopting the habitual confidence that Wyman associated with him. A few seconds later, he was back.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “There's nobody there” he said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The others regarded him mutely, a single silent question written on their faces. Ríos shrugged.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “There's nobody there” he repeated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shuffling around the corner, they stepped up to the gates, casting wary glances around the sparse interstitial room: clouded windows and wan potted plants. The camera blinked placidly down at them from above the heavy-duty security door, but Ríos was right, there was nobody watching the feed behind the desk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Makes things simpler” muttered Antonescu, to general nervous assent. Someone - it might have been Ríos - forced a chuckle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Halfway along the corridor to the second checkpoint, the strip lights faded with a slow, dying whine. The darkened building suddenly seemed much quieter. Beside him, Wyman heard Clijsters rummaging in her bag, then the click of a flashlight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The beam raked across their pale faces: Wyman, with his round-rimmed glasses and sensible haircut; Gordon, also bespectacled, but bejowled too; Antonescu, dark-haired and sharp-featured; and Ríos, bearded, and tanned, and smiling, even now. Slowly, almost comically, a fifth face loomed, lantern-like, from out of the darkness behind him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For a moment, all was chaos, and shouting, and blood.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ríos was dead before he hit the floor, blood gushing freely from where his head used to be. It leapt onto Clijsters, clinging to her back like an overzealous toddler. Long, bloodied teeth sank deep into her neck, and her cries quickly devolved into gurgled whimpers, her flashlight falling limply from her hand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wyman backpedalled wildly, colliding with Gordon and sending both of them sprawling. Above him, Antonescu's revolver barked twice, and the creature flew off Clijsters, who was left convulsing against the wall. Gordon, scrambling to his knees, lunged for the flashlight and swung it up over the scene.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Three sets of eyes glinted back at them. The light shone off too many teeth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wyman was up on his feet and running in seconds, Gordon and Antonescu falling into frantic step beside him. Some animal instinct governed them now, the atavistic impulse that separated predator from prey, and worked to maintain that distinction. Antonescu snapped another two shots behind them as they ran, her long legs beginning to distance her from the others. Gordon puffing away at his heels, Wyman desperately pressed forward, wild keening cries filling his ears.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He didn't see Gordon fall, only registered the swinging beam behind him disappear. He sprinted on, wild-eyed in the dark, tearing around a corner, groping blindly for the walls as he forced his legs onwards. His shirt snagged on a door handle and jerked him backwards. Impulsively, he pushed down, stumbling into the room and slamming the door behind him. He clasped his hand over his mouth, lungs screaming in protestation, and sank down, back to the door, listening to the receding howls in the corridor. One final gunshot, then silence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After a miserable 20 minutes running through the probabilities, Wyman came to the unhappy conclusion that he had to continue. If anyone else had made it, the vault was the most likely rendezvous. Besides, there had been no sounds from the corridor since his desperate escape, and waiting here until dawn was not an option. He inched the door open; listened hard: nothing. A few paces down the corridor, his foot made contact with something hard that skittered across the floor. He fumbled to stop its motion - the revolver! But then where was Antonescu? He listened again, praying he hadn't been heard, blood pounding in his ears: nothing. He slipped the revolver into his pack.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He didn't know how long he spent in the dark, manoeuvring himself forward with agonising slowness. Occasionally, distant shrieks caused him to freeze, heart jumping as he stood motionless, eyes screwed up against the darkness. But eventually, he sensed the corridor giving way to a larger space. He edged forward, one hand on the wall, feeling with the other for what he desperately hoped would be the bars of the second security gate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Relief coursed through him as his hand closed around the railing. His knees buckled as he realised the gate was already open. That meant someone else had survived, and - was that a soft glow ahead? <em>Don't go into the light</em>, a voice rose unbidden in his head, some quote from an old movie. Wyman almost smiled. But of course, the vault must have its own generator - a failsafe, he assumed. He edged forward through the gate, to where a sliver of light spilled out from behind a heavy plate steel door. He snaked his fingers into the gap, swinging it open just enough to slip through.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A hand shot out as he made to pull it shut behind him. Antonescu, dark hair loose over her blood-streaked face, gave him a tight smile.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Don't want to be trapped here”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wyman nodded; smiled weakly back.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Antonescu stepped away, and he took stock of his surroundings. Somehow, impossibly, they had made it. The vault: the cylinder-shaped safe in a clinical white room. Wyman slipped off his pack and sank to his haunches, disjointed images rising unbidden in his mind. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kovacs, lying prone in that cable car high above the facility. The couple from the milk bar, walking arm-in-arm down the street. Ríos' smiling face, illuminated by the flashlight. Clijsters, slumped against the wall, half her neck missing. A distant keening cry brought him back to the present.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beside him, Antonescu ran her thumb over her lips, then stepped towards the safe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I wasn't sure you'd make it,” she said, bent over the keypad, her voice oddly toneless. She briefly turned her head to face him. “You have the code, don't you?”. Her hand twitched at her side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wyman looked down at his pack, a couple of feet away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Again, he ran the numbers. It wasn't a complicated sum.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The report was almost deafening in the enclosed space. Antonescu slumped sideways, leaving a trail of blood against the casing of the safe. Wyman ignored the ringing in his ears; the rising bile in his throat, and stumbled forwards, sweat slicking the keypad as he jabbed in the code. He shook his head furiously. Forget what had happened: he was so close now. So close to the biggest payday of his life. So close to having the power to affect change: real, actual change, not just for Greta and for his family but for the whole city. With a pneumatic hiss, the lock disengaged, the door swung open, and…
                    </p>
